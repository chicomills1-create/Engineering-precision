Do not treat an in-process interval inside an autoscaling web service as a guaranteed exact-time scheduler. Use a durable scheduled trigger plus transactional queue claims or leases, with a preflight count before dispatch.

**Why:** Autoscaling services may be idle, restarted, or running multiple instances at the target time. An interval can therefore run late, not run, or run concurrently, even when message-level deduplication reduces duplicate delivery risk.

**How to apply:** For any commitment to dispatch a fixed batch at 8:00 AM America/Phoenix, prepare and verify the queue beforehand, require the full eligible count, trigger dispatch through a durable scheduler, and monitor the claimed, accepted, delivered, and stopped counts.
